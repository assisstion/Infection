## The Math

By interacting with the exhibit, the users should develop a sense of the network effect: When the flu is still in the initial stages, it is possible to quickly exterminate it, but after it has reached the more populous and central areas, it is near impossible.

## The Submission

The objective of the users is to cure the “people” circles of the “avian flu,” which is represented by a pink color. The people cannot walk in the water, and they cannot walk through the user blobs. The users can cure the flu by stepping on infected people.
The easiest way to win the game is to quarantine the most populous and central areas and tackle the flu while it is still in an spread-out state. This intuition for the network effect is unavoidable for any user who understands the strategy necessary to win.
The game is quite entertaining for all users, but especially for active children who would enjoy running around the board to quickly stamp out the epidemic.
